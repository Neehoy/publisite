<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="post-entry">
                    <h2>Our commitment to privacy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Neehoy is committed to ensuring the privacy of our members. &nbsp;We collect information from our members to improve the quality of the service that we offer. &nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a service that is secure and trustworthy is of the utmost importance , if you believe you have encountered any security or privacy problems when using Neehoy please report them immediately to <a href="mailto:info@neehoy.com">info@neehoy.com</a> to help keep the service secure for you and all other members.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3></p>
<p dir="ltr">Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a Neehoy account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture). This information allows us to help you or others be “found” on Neehoy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Communications between you and Neehoy. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><h3>Finding your friends on Neehoy:</h3></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you choose, you can use our “Find friends” feature to locate other people with Neehoy accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Neehoy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device’s contacts list, then Neehoy will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact list is using Neehoy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Neehoy then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Note about “Invite Friends” feature:&nbsp;If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Neehoy does not have access to or control of this communication.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><h3>Analytics information:</h3> &nbsp;We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><h3>Cookies and similar technologies:</h3> When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Neehoy and provide features to you. &nbsp;We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><h3>Log file information:</h3> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. &nbsp;When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How else may we use your personal information?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We may use your personal information to investigate a complaint made by another member, breach of Neehoy’s Terms of Use and to prevent and detect criminal activity, fraud and misuse of or damage to Neehoy or the service made available through it and to prosecute those responsible.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may, however, disclose information about you to the following, for the purposes set out below:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>If you sign up to access Neehoy services:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">To our employees and agents for them to administer any accounts or services provided to you through the site. e.g. the sending of e-alerts on our behalf or the e-mail a friend facility;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>If you post content:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a member you are publicly identified to other users of Neehoy by your name. We therefore recommend that you do not release any other personally identifiable information on the publicly viewable site, like your address or contact details – this should be the preserve of the private Neehoy messaging system between members.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We may display some information that is publicly available on Neehoy, on third party websites that are closely connected to the Neehoy project and wish to embed Neehoy activity.&nbsp; So, by way of example, user generated content would be displayed on such third party sites with a link back to Neehoy. To the extent that personal information is included in that user generated content on Neehoy, it may be displayed on such third party sites. So for example if a listing included a name or a member’s photo, that information may also be displayed on the third party website. Just to be clear, this information will be embedded on any such third party website as a link. We will not hand over that information to the third party website. &nbsp;We may display some information that is publicly available on Neehoy in the regular newsletters or social media bulletins that are emailed or sent to all registered users on the Neehoy mailing list.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Transfer of business:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of Neehoy or any of its assets, we may have to disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. &nbsp;If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential and use it in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from the use and sharing of your personal information in the limited circumstances already described, the only ways we may share your information are if we need to disclose personal information to protect our and our licensors’ rights and property or to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Using information about other members</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Once you decide to enter into an arrangement with another member, you may share personal information with each other in order to discuss and/or complete your arrangement. This information may include your name and contact details. &nbsp;Please read our Code of Conduct for tips on safety and don’t give any personal information to anyone until you are confident that it is safe to do so.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aggregated information</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We may share non-personal aggregated statistics data about visitors to Neehoy and traffic patterns with third parties. This information does not identify users in any personal capacity; it just gives generalised information about the users of Neehoy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Neehoy does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 18. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. &nbsp;If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at report@neehoy.com.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cookies</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While on Neehoy, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Neehoy. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to this site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Neehoy. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. IP addresses are not used to track your session and are not linked to anything personally identifiable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many websites we may use a feature called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. It allows us to recognise you as a user when you return to Neehoy using the same device and web browser. We use the cookies (including some provided to us through Google Analytics) and other automatically tracked information to:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Store login details. For example, user authentication when you log in to enable you to move more easily around Neehoy</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">track visitors to Neehoy to analyse performance and usage of Neehoy, in order to&nbsp; develop Neehoy in accordance with visitors’ requirements;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce functionality of Neehoy and may mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found on http://www.allaboutcookies.org under the ‘manage cookies’ section. Alternatively go to the help menu within your internet browser.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Links</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We are very selective about which sites we provide links to, however we do not control these websites, nor do we endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on third party sites.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How we collect personal information</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As required by the UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encode your password. SSL encrypts your password as it travels through the Internet. Encryption creates billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet. Despite using this technology, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to us. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing on-line and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence or wilful default. &nbsp;If you have any concerns about security, please email us at report@neehoy.com.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
<p dir="ltr">You can access and edit information provided in your Profile, listings and blogs. You cannot edit comments made to the forum, questions or answers or comments made to other users.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Your right to see your personal information</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to see the personal information that we hold about you, whether collected through your use of Neehoy or through any communications that you have had with us. You will need to provide us with a written request and pay a small fee. If you have any queries about your right or wish to make such a request please contact us by e-mail at info@neehoy.net or by post addressed to Neehoy Ltd., Sir Colin Campbell Building, Triumph Road, Nottingham, NG72TU</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to contact us about a deceased user</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the event of the death of a Neehoy User, please send us an email to the following email address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@neehoy.com">support@neehoy.com</a>. We will usually conduct our communication via email; should we require any other information, we will contact you at the email address you have provided in your request.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Neehoy may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Neehoy or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.</p>
