<h1 dir="ltr">4.&nbsp; About Neehoy</h1>
<h2 dir="ltr">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we do</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We provide mobile applications that allow Neehoy members to give their belongings to or share their belongings with other Neehoy members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members registered to Neehoy can use the application to identify other Members that may be able to assist in recycling through offline social interaction.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we don’t do</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We do not have any involvement in or responsibility for the arrangements you make with other members through Neehoy. They are solely private arrangements made directly between the individuals concerned.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identity Verification</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We do not monitor, check or verify the identity of anyone who registers with Neehoy or the information they provide. Nor do we carry out any checks (such as Criminal Record) on anyone who registers. &nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot therefore give any guarantee that any of the Neehoy Members are who they say they are or are appropriate for you to contact and we make no recommendations in relation to any of these Neehoy Members regardless of the category within which they are registered. &nbsp;Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">5. Interactions with other members</h1>
<h2 dir="ltr">5.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Neehoy provides a platform for members to learn and communicate with one another, arrange offline recycling activities and record a history of previous interactions. &nbsp;Neehoy is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services. &nbsp;We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services. &nbsp;When using the Neehoy mobile application you take full responsibility for who you have contact with and the nature, terms and extent of that contact. &nbsp;You are responsible for carrying out your own independent checks on other members before providing sensitive information such as contact details or deciding whether to meet or allow them to assist you in any way. &nbsp;Members may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Neehoy members; however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Neehoy and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">5.1.1 Reporting Concerns</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Each Neehoy Member, acts on his/her own behalf at all times and does not act as our representative or agent in any way. &nbsp;We neither endorse nor accept responsibility for any of the actions of any Neehoy Member. &nbsp;If you doubt the veracity and/or safety of another Neehoy Member or any information provided by them, immediately discontinue all contact. &nbsp;You agree to report all serious concerns to us via the “Report” buttons on the site and/or by emailing us at info@neehoy.com.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5.2 Release.</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, photos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”). You are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr">13. Exclusions and Limitations of liability</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Nothing in these Terms of Use will restrict our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence, or for any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded by law. &nbsp;Subject to this, the warranties contained in the remainder of this clause are in place of all warranties or conditions implied by law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We promise that we will operate Neehoy with reasonable skill and care and that we will use our reasonable endeavours to correct any faults of which we are aware. We do not make any promises about the availability of Neehoy or any services made available through it. In particular we disclaim any liability in connection with any technical problems you may experience with Neehoy which may result in interruptions to Neehoy or the service it delivers, or any bugs or viruses in the Neehoy Site, Neehoy mobile Application, the server that makes Neehoy available or the content made available through Neehoy. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to implement satisfactory safeguards and procedures to make sure any files you obtain through Neehoy are free from such contaminations or other harmful properties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We do not review listings nor are we involved in any arrangements made between users. The posting of listings on Neehoy and the uploading of photographs by Neehoy Members do not constitute any form of recommendation, representation, endorsement or arrangement by us. In particular we have no control over and are not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any content, its compliance with any legal or regulatory requirement, the quality, safety or legality of any items or help offered, the terms on which any such offers are made available to you, the ability of Neehoy Members to give or share items, nor of members to provide resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You accept that you take full responsibility for:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">any decision to give or share your belongings, produce or to offer help, as envisaged in your listing;</p>

<p dir="ltr">negotiating the terms of any contract to give or share belongings; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the resolution of any dispute between you and another user of Neehoy. Remember, your arrangement for the giving or sharing of belongings will be with your selected individual, not us. By offering the functionality to enable Neehoy Members to upload photographs, Neehoy does not in any way condone or encourage use by Neehoy Members or anyone else of the belongings or resources depicted in those photographs without the owner’s permission, nor does Neehoy accept any responsibility for the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Please note that any information posted via the functionality available on Neehoy is the opinion of the person posting only and, although we have rules for the posting of content, our interactive features are susceptible to misuse.
